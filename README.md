# Pomodoro Work Break Timer

A simple timer to help you take breaks while working. The timer is based on the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).<br>
A goal of the technique is to reduce the effect of internal and external interruptions on focus and flow.

This project was created using Nuxt.js and Tailwind CSS. Unit tests are written using Vitest.
